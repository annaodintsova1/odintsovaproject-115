          <h2>Portfolio</h2>
          <p>I am 18 years old and I live in Minsk, but I was born in Warsaw, where I lived with my parents for two years, thanks to this fact and the fact that my mother is a teacher of Polish language and culture, I speak Polish at A2 level and I am interested in the culture of this country and people living in it. In addition to Polish, I know English at B2 level, which I am currently studying at a private business institute with a degree in business administration. I also speak Russian and Belarusian.

Since childhood, my parents have sent me to all kinds of circles and sections. Over time, I began to try everything on my own and learn everything that there is an opportunity to learn. Now I believe that there is nothing that I could not master. Perhaps this is youthful maximalism, or perhaps I'm just very brave, but I believe in myself and my strengths. I am not used to giving up and I am not afraid of difficulties. 

Despite my young age, I already have experience in various places and areas. I first got a job at the age of 14 as a physical education teacher at a children's camp. It sounds, of course, implausible, but I conquered the employer with my self-confidence, besides, before that I went to a vacation camp and even then managed to establish myself as a very responsible and hardworking person. It was very difficult, I will not hide it, but thanks to the fact that I have two younger brothers and a younger sister, with whom it was most difficult to find a common language at one time, I won the trust and respect of children. Therefore, I can say with confidence that I can interest even the most fastidious, fickle and unpredictable audience - children. 

This was followed by the experience of working on the back in restaurants, and then at the age of 16 I already worked at the bar of a coffee shop. During these two years, I also worked at a bar with alcohol, and received training in coffee roasting companies, training in service and conflict resolution, and the basics of working with food products. I resolved conflicts with uncontrollable people, was present at the conclusion of contracts from the delivery of the product to the extension of the lease. Now I work in a coffee shop with specialty beans and alternative brewing methods. And it is probably hard to imagine a situation from which I would not have found a way out. I develop my communication skill every day, stepping out of my comfort zone, and accepting the challenge of this society, believing that this is one of the most useful skills that I will definitely need.
In parallel with this, I have been a practicing photographer for three years already (I will attach a portfolio with my work below). For me, photography is not only a hobby, but also an additional income. However, I am critical of this kind of earnings, I call it: “milking the camera”. For me, my little Nikon is a friend with whom we have been through so much that I simply cannot afford to rape him with non-creative and soulless shooting. The philosophy and the subject of photography are important to me. The world through the lens is beautiful, and over time you learn to see beauty in everything without it. This is what helps me not to drown in the overwhelming realism of this world.
I also subsequently my works serve as the basis for the designs of my postcards, which I sell. 

For the last year I have also been engaged in customization and design of clothes. For me, as a person who is accustomed to living modestly and thrift with what makes my life comfortable, it is unacceptable to throw things away simply because they are dirty, torn or out of fashion, so I give them a second life by making changes in their appearance. 
 
As you can already understand, I monetize everything I can. But there is one niche in which I am just as strong, but I have not yet had the opportunity to work in it. This is analysis. I have been reading and analyzing since childhood. I love to write reviews of what I've read, and sometimes I write my own. All my teachers tell me that my analytical mind paired with creative thinking generate thoughts and ideas that deserve attention. 

I have loved this attention since childhood, I love the audience, I love to speak, give lectures, be in the spotlight and manage this attention. I have leadership qualities and I try to implement them. I get incredible pleasure from organizing an event and I really like to understand that something depends on me. It is always a pleasure for me to be the leader of the group, to delegate and control. I love competition and I think my role is that of a champion. And I understand perfectly well that the path is extremely thorny. I understand that with such ambitions it will be very difficult for me, but I want to take everything from this life. I want to try everything: herding sheep in the Alps, and cooking a pilaf cauldron for children in Africa, and taking part in conferences on solving world issues, I want people to smile and unearth their best qualities with my help, I want to master even more languages I want to get to know as many people as possible, to learn from them everything that they can give me, I want to be able to realize all my projects and do as much as possible not only for my loved ones, but for the whole world. 

My father has been repeating one phrase to me every morning since I was a child before I go to work. These words sound like this: "... and do not forget to do good."
This is my life motto. Because I believe that all good things come back to you, I believe that everyone deserves a good attitude towards themselves and a second chance, I believe that there are reasons for everything and everything has consequences. 

Now I'm on the verge of something unknown, trying and learning, hoping and believing. Therefore, I am writing to you, offering myself to work in the role for which it is possible. I am ready for new experiences, new challenges, new knowledge. 
Therefore, I will look forward to your reply. 
Sincerely, Anna Odintsova
